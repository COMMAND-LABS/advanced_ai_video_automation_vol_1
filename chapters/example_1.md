# TLDR

Details regarding Example 1

## Script

```.txt - generated by GPT-4o
Here’s a trick to sound 30% wittier in conversations even if you’re not that fast. When someone asks a question, don’t answer it right away. Flip the frame. Change how the question is seen. For example, if someone asks: "So, are you finally seeing someone?". You could then say: “I see people all the time. That’s how I avoid walking into them.”. Try this today. Don’t just answer, redirect the angle of conversation. Wit isn’t always about speed. Sometimes it’s about redirecting the conversation. Follow for more Wit Training.

## Systems used to produce the video

`Make.com` was used to showcase each step of this video creation pipeline but another low-code or coding platform like `n8n` or even `Python` scripting could have been used too...

- Script: `GPT-4o`
- Narrated audio: `ElevenLabs`
- Script segmentation: `Whisper` (through the `OpenAI` API) *(audio/text)-2-text
- Image prompts: `GPT-4o`
- Images: `Flux Dev` (through `Leonardo.ai`) *(image/text)-2-image
- Video: `Kling 2.1` (through `fal.ai`) *(image/text)-2-video
- Final Compilation: `JSON2Video`

## Costs of producing a ~30-second video

1. `ChatGPT` used to write the script
  - $20/month
2. `ElevenLabs` used to convert the script into audio
  - notice how I fine-tuned the generated audio from ElevenLabs on my voice
  - $5/month
3. `OpenAI API`
  - Whisper was used to break the script into segments so we can synchronize the generated video with different parts of the script - IF THIS SOUNDS CONFUSING IT'S SUPER SIMPLE AS YOU'LL SOON SEE - fyi: using Whisper for this costs less than 1¢ per request
  - GPT-4o used to build our image prompts
  - Credits based aka $5-$10 is enough
4. `Leonardo.ai web app`
  - Helps us use the Leonardo platform
  - You could technically just use the Leonardo.ai API and avoid subscribing for the web app but I found the web app useful for experimenting with the different features offered by the Leonardo.ai platform
  - $12/month
5. `Leonardo.ai API`
  - Used to convert the image prompts we generated for each script segment in STEP 3 into images
  - $9/month
6. `Kling v2.1`
  - Used to convert the images for each script segment into video clips that we will later string together to make our final video
  - We used Kling v2.1 through the fal.ai API ie: https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/kling-video/v2.1/master/image-to-video/playground
  - NOTE: Each request to generate video costs $1.40/second of generated video with each additional second costing $0.28.
  - FOR CONTEXT: Generating a 30-second video costed me $19.60 through fal.ai's API
7. `JSON2Video`
  - Used to stitch the narrated audio with the generated clips along with any other elements (like subtitles) together
  - $49.95/7,200 credits (~120 minutes of rendered video) after free credits expire

MINIMUM ESTIMATE OF RUNNING THIS SYSTEM AS OF 7/6/2025: $126 (plus at least ~$20-$40 per each additional video produced using `Kling v2.1`)
