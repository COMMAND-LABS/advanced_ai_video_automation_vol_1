## Script

```.txt - generated by Claude Sonnet 4
Get ready! Your brain is about to get stronger. Ready for today's wit workout? If someone says: 'You're not very good at this, are you?' QUICK! What's your comeback?

OPTION A: 'Well, I'm better at it than you are at being polite.'
OPTION B: 'I'm practicing selective excellence.'
OPTION C: 'Good enough to know when someone's fishing for attention.'

The truth is there is no right answer. All are valid comebacks. The key to this exercise is speed. When you're fast and precise with your responses to offensive remarks then people will find you witty. Your challenge for the day is to practice comebacks. When someone throws shade your way don’t freeze but respond quickly. You’ll get more accurate with your responses the more you practice.

## Systems used to produce the video

`Make.com` was used to showcase each step of this video creation pipeline but another low-code or coding platform like `n8n` or even `Python` scripting could have been used too...

- Script: `Claude Sonnet 4`
- Narrated audio: `ElevenLabs`
- Script segmentation: `Whisper` (through the `OpenAI` API) *(audio/text)-2-text
- Video prompts: `GPT-4o`
- Video: `Veo 3` (through `fal.ai`) *text-2-video
- Final Compilation: `JSON2Video`

## Costs of producing a ~30-second video

1. `Claude Desktop` used to write the script
  - $20/month
2. `ElevenLabs` used to convert the script into audio
  - notice how I fine-tuned the generated audio from ElevenLabs on my voice
  - $5/month
3. `OpenAI API`
  - Whisper was used to break the script into segments so we can synchronize the generated video with different parts of the script - IF THIS SOUNDS CONFUSING IT'S SUPER SIMPLE AS YOU'LL SOON SEE - fyi: using Whisper for this costs less than 1¢ per request
  - GPT-4o used to build our video prompts
  - Credits based aka $5-$10 is enough
4. `Veo 3`
  - Used to convert the prompts for each script segment into video clips that we will later string together to make our final video
  - We used Veo 3 through the fal.ai API ie: https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/veo3/playground
  - NOTE: Each request to generate video costs $0.50/second (audio off) or $0.75/second (audio on). For example, a 5s video with audio on will cost $3.75.
  - FOR CONTEXT: Generating a 38-second video costed me $71.64 through fal.ai's API
7. `JSON2Video`
  - Used to stitch the narrated audio with the generated clips along with any other elements (like subtitles) together
  - $49.95/7,200 credits (~120 minutes of rendered video) after free credits expire

MINIMUM ESTIMATE OF RUNNING THIS SYSTEM AS OF 7/6/2025: $155 (plus at least $60-$100/video produced by `Veo 3` through the fal.ai API)
