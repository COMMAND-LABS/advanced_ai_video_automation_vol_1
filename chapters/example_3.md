## Script

```.txt - generated by Grok 3
"Welcome to Wit in a Minute!"<break time="0.2s" />

"Today’s lesson: the art of the clever comeback. Picture this, you’re at a party and someone says to you: Wow, you look like you’re enjoying yourself."<break time="0.2s" />

"You could respond with a dull: Yup. or you could flip the flat comment on it’s head by replying with something like: Wow, I’d say that's the worst opener I've ever heard."

"Wit is about surprise and speed. Here’s your challenge: next time someone tosses you a boring comment, flip it with a playful twist. For example, if someone says: Nice shoes. Reply with something like: I use them to run away from bad conversations."

"Practice it, own it, and stay sharp. Stay tuned for more wit!"

## Systems used to produce the video

`Make.com` was used to showcase each step of this video creation pipeline but another low-code or coding platform like `n8n` or even `Python` scripting could have been used too...

- Script: `Grok 3`
- Narrated audio: `ElevenLabs`
- AI Motion Avatar: `HeyGen API`
- Script segmentation: `Whisper` (through the `OpenAI` API) *(audio/text)-2-text
- Image prompts: `GPT-4o`
- Images: `Flux Dev` (through `Leonardo.ai`) *text-2-image
- Final Compilation: `JSON2Video`

## Costs of producing a 30-second video

1. `Grok` used to write the script
  - FREE
  - https://grok.com/ 
2. `ElevenLabs` used to convert the script into audio
  - notice how I fine-tuned the generated audio from ElevenLabs on my voice
  - $5/month
3. `HeyGen web app` used to help use the HeyGen platform
  - $29/month
4. `HeyGen API` used to generate the AI Motion Avatar video
  - $99/month
5. `OpenAI API`
  - Whisper was used to break the script into segments so we can synchronize the generated video with different parts of the script - IF THIS SOUNDS CONFUSING IT'S SUPER SIMPLE AS YOU'LL SOON SEE - fyi: using Whisper for this costs less than 1¢ per request
  - GPT-4o used to build our image prompts
  - Credits based aka $5-$10 is enough
6. `Leonardo.ai web app`
  - Helps us use the Leonardo platform
  - You could technically just use the Leonardo.ai API and avoid subscribing for the web app but I found the web app useful for experimenting with the different features offered by the Leonardo.ai platform
  - $12/month
7. `Leonardo.ai API`
  - Used to convert the image prompts we generated for each script segment in STEP 3 into images
  - $9/month
8. `JSON2Video`
  - Used to stitch the narrated audio with the generated clips along with any other elements (like subtitles) together
  - $49.95/7,200 credits (~120 minutes of rendered video) after free credits expire

MINIMUM ESTIMATE OF RUNNING THIS SYSTEM AS OF 7/6/2025: $214
